        <p>For many years, LGBT+ members struggle with the idea of expressing themselves. They fear that by sharing how they feel and/or coming out, they will dismantle their existing relationships with family and/or friend. 
        </p>
         <p>
            As a member of the LGBT+ community, I can say first-hand that the journey in itself is overwhelming. There were so many things that I was trying to figure out all at once about myself. I was too scared to confide in anyone and wished that there was a place for me to feel open and free to express with no worry.
        </p>
        <p> Voice4VOICE is a social outlet that helps individuals within the LGBT+ community tackle their inner struggles by enabling them to display their truths in hopes that others will be inspired to display theirs. Hence the title, “Voice4VOICE”.
        </p>
    <p>As an entry for Voice4VOICE, my team and I decided to construct an interview where we asked an individual to take part in a Q&A in relation to their personal experiences and how they overcame certain obstacles throughout their life. </p>
